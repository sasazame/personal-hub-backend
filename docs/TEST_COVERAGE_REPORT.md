# Test Coverage Report

## Current Status

As of June 2025, the Personal Hub Backend has the following test coverage:

### Coverage Summary

| Component | Coverage | Status |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Services** | ~40% | ðŸŸ¡ Needs improvement |
| **Controllers** | ~30% | ðŸ”´ Critical gaps |
| **Repositories** | 0% | ðŸ”´ No unit tests |
| **Security** | ~60% | ðŸŸ¡ JWT tested, others missing |
| **Infrastructure** | Limited | ðŸŸ¡ Selective coverage |

### Test Statistics
- **Total Tests**: 175
- **Passing**: All tests pass (after recent fixes)
- **Test Types**: Unit tests, Integration tests, Security tests

## Areas With Good Coverage âœ…

1. **Authentication & JWT**
   - `JwtService` - Comprehensive tests
   - `JwtAuthenticationFilter` - Well tested
   - JWT configuration and validation

2. **Specific Features**
   - Goal management (GoalServiceV2)
   - Password validation
   - Some controller integration tests

3. **Security Tests**
   - Authentication flow
   - JWT token handling
   - Basic security configurations

## Critical Gaps ðŸ”´

### High Priority Services (Core Business Logic)
1. **TodoService** - Only partial coverage
2. **EventService** - No tests
3. **NoteService** - No tests
4. **EmailService** implementations - No tests

### Controllers Missing Tests
1. **TodoController** - Main CRUD operations
2. **EventController** - All endpoints
3. **NoteController** - All endpoints
4. **GoalController** - Unit tests missing

### Infrastructure Components
1. **GlobalExceptionHandler** - No tests
2. **Repository implementations** - No unit tests
3. **Mappers** - No tests

## Recommendations for First Release

### Minimum Required Tests
For a production-ready first release, add tests for:

1. **Core Services** (High Priority)
   ```
   - TodoService (complete coverage)
   - Basic EmailService tests
   - SecurityEventService
   ```

2. **Main Controllers** (Medium Priority)
   ```
   - TodoController (CRUD operations)
   - Basic error handling tests
   ```

3. **Critical Infrastructure** (Medium Priority)
   ```
   - GlobalExceptionHandler
   - TokenEncryptionService
   ```

### Future Improvements
After first release, focus on:
- Event and Note services/controllers
- OAuth/OIDC service coverage
- Repository layer unit tests
- Performance and load testing

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
mvn test

# Generate coverage report
mvn clean test jacoco:report

# Check coverage
./scripts/check-coverage.sh

# View detailed report
open target/site/jacoco/index.html
```

## Coverage Goals

- **First Release**: Minimum 60% overall coverage
- **Target**: 80% overall coverage
- **Service Layer**: 90% coverage target

## Notes

- Integration tests provide some coverage for untested units
- OAuth/OIDC components may be adequately tested through integration
- Repository layer might not need unit tests if integration tests are comprehensive
